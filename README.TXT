The aim is to produce a financial trading application simulation as a learning exercise in C# 5, .NET 4.5 and WPF 4.5. 
To make it more relevant to the business, we've also pre-selected some additional APIs which are at least candidates for use in a real-world application.

Rob initially provided a few example windows/screens and identified a few technologies to incorporate, namely SignalR and Reactive Extensions.
Robin and Duncan have taken Rob's sheet of A4, fleshed it out a bit and come up with something a little more concrete (two sheets, no less), with an incremental development path lending itself to frequent reviews.

(This readme itself is part of the learning exercise, my having only ever used git from a command line, and only then very briefly. I'm following Git's landing page for new users to learn how to use Git's browser-based interface.)
