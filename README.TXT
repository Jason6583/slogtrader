The aim is to produce a financial trading application simulation as a learning exercise in C# 5, .NET 4.5 and WPF 4.5. 
To make it more relevant to the business, we've also pre-selected some additional APIs which are at least candidates for use in a real-world application.

Rob initially provided a few example windows/screens and identified a few technologies to incorporate, namely SignalR and Reactive Extensions.
Robin and Duncan have taken Rob's sheer of A4 and come up with something a bit more concrete, with an incremental development path.

(This readme itself is part of the learning exercise, my having only ever used git from a command line, and only then very briefly. I'm following Git's landing page for new users to learn how to use Git's browser-based interface.)
